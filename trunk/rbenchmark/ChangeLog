	* Polished code and documentation, updated repository site to be in sync
	with the package documentation.
	
	* Updated examples for more clarity.

	* DESCRIPTION (Package): Version set to 1.0

	* Modified the way replicated replications and labels are generated, so
	that replication of arguments is no longer needed, effectively solving the
	issue with rep not accepting non-numeric vectors.

	* DESCRIPTION (Package): Version set to 0.4.3

	* Added check on no expressions to benchmark to avoid obscure R error
	message.  benchmark will give a warning and return an invisible empty
	object.

2012-08-15 Berend Hasselman <bhh at xs4all.nl>

	* DESCRIPTION (Package): Version set to 0.4.2

	* modified R/benchmark.R to accommodate for R's rep() function no
	longer accepting non numeric vectors (this can happen when you
	benchmark function calls) in R-devel and R-2.15.1 patched.

	* removed the \dontrun{} around examplecode since it now works in
	R-devel and R-2.15.1 patched.

	* DESCRIPTION (Package): Version set to 0.4.1

	* R/benchmark.R: added functionality for the user to choose which
	column should be used for relative timings
	* man/benchmark.Rd: modified example 4 to show the above change

	2012 at https://code.google.com/p/rbenchmark/downloads/list

	* man/benchmark.Rd: Wrap \dontrun{} around example code
